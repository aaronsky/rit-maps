At the same time, it can generate academic, emotional, personal, social, and even financial concerns. Although not uncommon, at times these concerns can make it difficult to succeed or function while at school. Counseling is an excellent way to address such issues, to learn more about yourself and others, to develop new life skills, and to explore and gain insight, understanding and acceptance.</p>\n\n<p><b>Career Assessment and Counseling</b>\nMany students at RIT change their major after arriving at college. For some, this process is clear and quite effortless. For others, it can be a difficult process involving a lot of questions and exploration. Some students may also have academic difficulty in their chosen major, be interested in plotting their next coop job or permanent placement, or have questions about graduate school application and selection processes.</p>\n\n<p><b>Scope of Services</b>\nRIT's Counseling Center is structured to provide short term, time-limited counseling. The duration of treatment varies according to students' needs, but counselors work to provide relatively brief treatment in order to facilitate adjustment, successful functioning, problem resolution, and symptom relief as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<p><b>Consultation Services</b>\nFaculty, staff and family members are often in a unique position to assist students in distress. Unfortunately, many students fail to get the professional help they need. The Counseling Center staff welcomes the opportunity to consult with families or members of the campus community to assist you in your work and interactions with students. </p>",

The original plans showed a pair of towering brick monoliths at the entrance to the Institute, in keeping with the starkly brutalist vision of the original architectural plan. However by the time the new campus was completed in 1968, the monoliths had disappeared.

However, when RIT's basketball team went undefeated in 1955, Harry Watts, head of the RIT News Bureau, met with several RIT letterman and decided to use the nickname Tigers in an effort to better personify the the basketball team and RIT athletics.</p>\n<p>The RIT Tiger Committe was formed in 1963 to maintain the mascot of the Institute, manage the use and display of said mascot, and secure and distribute the funds needed for the management. The Committee purchased a two-month old Bengal tiger for $1000, which was financed by $1 shares sold to students, faculty, and staff.</p>\n<p>Spirit was flown in from Dallas, Texas, and received the nickname Flying Tiger. While still a cub, Spirit was brought to many RIT athletic events. \nIn the spring of 1963, Spirit was moved to the Seneca Park Zoo. A year and a half later, X-rays showed he was sufferring from pelvic and leg joint problems. Spirit was euthanized on September 28, 1964. The Seneca Park Zoo and RIT purchased another cub in honor of Spirit and named him Spirit II.</p>\n<p>The student-commissioned Bengal tiger statue across from the Eastman Quad was dedicated on November 10, 1989. The tiger's sculptor, Duff Wehle, stated at the dedication ceremony: Through joint efforts of these people\u0014foundry craftsmen color artists\u0014we have provided a bronze statue of RIT's mascot. Now it is up to all of you here at RIT to breathe life into it.</p>\n\n<p>Bronze</p>\n<p>3' x 10' x 3'</p>",

Credit-bearing FYE classes focus on topics including independent thinking and problem solving skills, ethical decision making, personal and social responsibility, and professional networking, as well as academic fundamentals such as time management, study skills, and working in teams. Each class carries one credit hour meaning that it meets once-per-week. Discovery classes are composed of students from the same major, while Pathways classes are multidisciplinary.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Discovery and Pathways instructors provide coaching on academic, personal and social issues. This element of the FYE program sets the RIT FYE program apart from other first-year programs around the country. Coaching is not counseling. Rather than being a problem-based meeting with a counselor, the goal of coaching is to provide an academic and career focused meeting to identify goals and the steps and resources which can facilitate that goal becoming a reality.</p>",

Cary was director of Continental Type Founders Association (a type-importing agency), a former president of the American Institute of Graphic Arts, and proprietor of the private Press of the Woolly Whale. His professional and personal interests in printing led him to collect printer's manuals and type specimens, as well as great books of the printer's art. In 1969, the Cary Collection was presented to RIT by the Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust as a memorial to Mr. Cary, together with funds to support the use and growth of the collection. Today the library houses some 40,000 volumes and a growing number of manuscripts and correspondence collections. ",
